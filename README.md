# satellite-mockup
A software mockup of the satellite for testing our control systems.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to simulate the physical satellite that our club is tasked with creating.
We're doing this in order to determine our needs, both in control and in communication, around the satellite. 
A simulation is an imperfect tool for this job, but it should help us make some early decisions and allow us to do work before the real thing is constructed.
